"""
This example script shows how to set up a stand alone battery with custom dispatch using a default battery model
Any list of floats with length analysis_period * steps_in_year can be used for dispatch

Additional financial models, inputs, and outputs can be found at https://nrel-pysam.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/Battery.html

Most recently tested against PySAM 6.0.0
