"""
This script provides an example of downloading a rate from URDB and processing it in "forecast" mode
The forecast code looks at the step-by-step (default hourly) costs of the rate, based on forecasts of generation and load
This can either be run with all of the steps at once (single call to execute()) to generate an array of prices
or by calling execute repeateadly, potentially in the loop with a model-predictive controller for energy storage

Most recently tested against PySAM 6.0.0
