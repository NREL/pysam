"""
This example script shows how to set up a residential pv battery system with custom dispatch
Any list of floats with length analysis_period * steps_in_year can be used for dispatch (steps_in_year determined by weather file)

This example requires a typical model year (tmy) weather file, which can be downloaded using the SAM GUI

Additional financial models, inputs, and outputs can be found at:
* PV: https://nrel-pysam.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/Pvsamv1.html
* Battery: https://nrel-pysam.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/Battery.html

Most recently tested against PySAM 6.0.0
