List of SAM Configurations
==========================================

A SAM configuration is a combination of performance and financial models that represents a renewable energy project. Each configuration consists of a series of compute modules that must be executed in the correct order.

For example, the Detailed PV -- Commercial configuration combines the Detailed PV performance model with the Commercial financial model to represent a photovoltaic system owned by a commercial business. It consists of the PVsamv1, Grid, Utilityrate5, and Cashloan modules.

Each configuration available in SAM is listed below with a description and list of compute modules in the correct execution order. Use the list as a reference when you are creating a model for a configuration.

The configurations and their inputs are described in SAM's Help system. For an online version, see `SAM Help <https://samrepo.nrelcloud.org/help/index.html>`_.
