Building PySAM from Source
==========================================

Building PySAM from source is only necessary if you are working with a custom or modified SSC compute module. Building from source requires first building SAM. For instructions, see "Building from Source" in the `PySAM wiki <https://github.com/NREL/pysam/wiki>`_ on GitHub.

If you are building SAM for NREL DAO-Tk, see :doc:`pyssc-for-dao-tk`.
